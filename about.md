Hello. My name is Austin. I was born in Austin, TX. I moved to Hailey, ID last year and had to stay at a scary place with my friends. We yelled a lot. One day, a human walked me and I went and lived at their house. Now humans walk me all the time. So this website is about my walks. 

You can follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/52261782) is you want to see my walks.
