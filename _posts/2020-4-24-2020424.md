Today, I did many walks! I got to see my friend Piper and go to a place I haven't been in a long time.

In the morning, I went on a walk with man human. His paws are hurting so he has to walk slow.

The lady human stopped talking to her glowy box for a short time so we could play with my friend Piper. One time Piper came into my yard and I did not like it and Piper's lady human yelled loud and Piper never came into my yard again. She just shouts hello from the street. Now we only play in Piper's yard. Piper is very very zoomy. I cannot zoom as fast as Piper but she likes me anyway.

Today, I kept trying to go inside Piper's house to find snacks, but her lady human kept chasing me out. I must change my tactics. I will practice my stealthy moves.

In the afternoon, me and humans took a caride to place I haven't been in awhile. I saw many dog friends and had to walk on the leash. It was very nice to be back there. We even got to walk around in a town a little bit. Man humans paws are still hurting so we had to turn around. The humans picked up a very good smelling bag. They would not let me investigate.

I will walk again tomorrow. 

Happy tails,
