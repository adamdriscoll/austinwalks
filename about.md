Hello. My name is Austin. I was born in Austin, TX. I moved to Hailey, ID last year and had to stay at a scary place with many friends. We talked all day but did not go on enough walks. One day, a lady human walked me and then I met a man human. I went and lived at their home. Now my humans walk me all the time. This blog is about my walks and my many adventures.

You can follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/52261782) is you want to see my walks.
