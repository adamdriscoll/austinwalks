Today, I did two walks. In the morning, I did a little walk with the man human. He needs to take me somewhere new. He keeps taking me to Water Gulch. I can only chase the same flappy snacks so many times.

After some time, the lady human and I went to the path with lots of rolly monsters. I was a very good boy. I did not chase any rolly monsters. I did not go in any friends' yards. I did not chase any humans. The lady human gave me many treats in return. On the way home we took my favorite trail. It was hot so I laid in the shade.

Then I protected the yard while the humans went away on their rolly monsters. After they returned, the lady human poured water on hers. I helped by licking it and drinking the water. I vomited it. I deserve a treat for my suffering.

I will walk again tomorrow. 

Happy tails,
