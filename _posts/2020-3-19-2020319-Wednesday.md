title: My New Watch
---

The small human gave me a new watch today. I can now record all my activities. There are many. Today, I took a walk in my favorite morning walk area. Water Gulch is right near my home. I found several elk bones and chewed many sticks. I even found human junk that the humans found interesting. I met a new friend at the end of the walk but the humans would not let us play. 

Here is my morning walk.
