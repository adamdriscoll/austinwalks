Hello. My name is Austin. I was born in Austin, TX. I moved to Hailey, ID last year and had to stay at a scary place with many friends. We talked all day but did not go on enough walks. One day, a lady human walked me and then I met a man human. I went and lived at their home. Now my humans walk me all the time. This blog is about my walks and my many adventures.

You can follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/52261782) if you want to see my walks. I post many beautiful pictures of myself on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/austin_walks). You can know the minute I go on walks if you follow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/austin_walks).
