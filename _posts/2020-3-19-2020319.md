The lady human gave me a new watch today. I can now record all my activities. There are many. Today, I walked in Water Gulch with the humans. It is my favorite morning walk area. I showed the humans many great things. I found several elk bones and chewed many sticks. I even found human junk that the humans found interesting.

I met a new friend at the end of the walk but the humans would not let us play. 

Here is my morning walk.

For my afternoon walk, the lady human took me down a path filled with rolly monsters, humans and other friends. Lady human talked to herself the entire time. I enjoyed the many smells and chewed many sticks.

I was left by myself in the yard for many, many hours. I enjoyed notifying the tiny humans that live near us that I was in the there. I then napped.

I did another walk in the evening but forgot my watch at home. Man human let me run in a canyon where I hunted many flappy snacks. I have not caught one yet but will keep trying. I will record this walk another time. 

It is now time to nap. I will walk again tomorrow.
